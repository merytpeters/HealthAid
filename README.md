The team's collective effort, creativity, and technical expertise made this project possible.

Challenges
The development of HealthAid was not without challenges. The main obstacles encountered during the course of the project include:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Health applications require adherence to strict standards and regulations, which posed a challenge given our time constraints. The app has not yet undergone the necessary documentation processes for full regulatory compliance.
- **Accuracy of Health Data**: While the app provides useful health insights, it does not offer 100% accuracy in diagnosis. Therefore, it is essential for users to consult with healthcare professionals for accurate diagnosis and treatment plans.
- **API Integration**: Integrating external APIs for both drug interaction checking and symptom analysis presented some technical hurdles, including compatibility issues and data retrieval complexities.
- **Time Constraints**: Due to the limited development period, certain features could not be fully developed or documented as initially planned. Despite this, the app still provides a valuable resource for health management.
